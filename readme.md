# Workbench/Library for FPGA Development

<h3 style="color:salmon"> About This Repository </h3>

The goal of this repository is to maintain a record of:

1. Development and upkeep of a basic components library to be used across all projects
2. Development of expiremental blocks and systems, before being used in a project

<h3 style="color:navy"> Where to Find Everything </h3>

- If you are intrested in seeing the source files for the basic and experimental blocks, go to `tb_lib.srcs/sources_1/new/`
- You can find a description of each block and its status, as either `lib` or `exp`, below
